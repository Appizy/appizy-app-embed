App Embed provides a very easy and efficient way to embed your web-calculator created with Appizy.

== Description ==

Code Embed allows you to embed code - JavaScript and HTML primarily - in a post. This is incredibly useful for embedding video, etc, when required and is used, amongst other, by Mozilla. It cannot be used for server side code, such as PHP.

Key features include...

* Add HTML or JavaScript to posts or pages - particularly useful for embedding videos!
* Embed in widgets using the [Widget Logic](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/widget-logic/ "Widget Logic") plugin
* Global embedding allows you set up some code in one post or page and then access it from another
* Modify the keywords or identifiers used for embedding the code to your own choice
* Search for embedding code via a simple search option
* Add a simple suffix to the embed code to convert videos to responsive output
* Embed an external script directly using just the URL
* And much, much more!
